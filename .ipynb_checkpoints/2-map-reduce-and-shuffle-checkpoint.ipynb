    "Notice that the task in the middle was called map partitions.  As we look at our Spark UI, we'll tend to see this a lot.  Map partitions is quite similar to map.  But map will execute our code one time for each record.  So if we have 2,000 records our related code will be called 2000 times.  With map partitions, the function is called only once per partition.  so if those 2,000 records are divided into 20 partitions, then the related function is only called 20 times.  This is more efficient call.  And it's for this reason that spark will translate our functions into map partitions under the hood."

    "In this lesson, we learned about Spark performs map reduce, operations that result in shuffling, and how to see these steps using the Spark UI.  We saw that by partitioning our dataset, Spark operations like filter and map across all partitions simultaneously.  And we also saw that one thing to be careful of is shuffling, which occurs when Spark needs to repartition the data to perform the operation.  This often happens with a group by operation.  Shuffling can be expensive because it can require sending data across different nodes in the cluster.\n",

    "We also learned about map partition which is similar to map.  The difference is that instead of performing an opeeration for each record, with map partition Spark performs an operation once per partition, which is faster."
